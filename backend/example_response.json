	{'model': 'google/gemini-3-pro-preview', 'response': 'Here is the grading assessment for Peter James Katsoukas.\n\n**Student:** Peter James Katsoukas\n**Course:** EGR-1110 Introduction to Engineering\n\n### **1. "What is engineering?"**\n**Score: 5/5**\n**Evidence:** The student initially defined it as *"the art of making what you want from stuff you can get."* Later, they added that it is about *"generating products and services from requirements."*\n**Reasoning:** While the initial definition was colloquial, it perfectly captured the core concept of engineering: achieving a specific objective ("what you want") using available resources ("stuff you can get"). The addition of "requirements" at the end of the interview showed a solid grasp of the formal design process.\n\n### **2. "Engineering and Creativity"**\n**Score: 5/5**\n**Evidence:** *"You need to be creative to get around all of the constraints required for the project."*\n**Reasoning:** The student correctly identified that engineering creativity is not just about aesthetics, but specifically about problem-solving within **constraints**. This is the fundamental distinction between artistic creativity and engineering creativity.\n\n### **3. "Engineering and Science"**\n**Score: 5/5**\n**Evidence:** *"Science is the way we inspect the real world and figure out the laws... Engineering needs to interact with the real world."*\n**Reasoning:** The student delineated the two clearly: Science is about discovery and understanding laws (inspection), while Engineering is about application and manipulation (interaction).\n\n### **4. "Engineering and Mathematics"**\n**Score: 5/5**\n**Evidence:** *"In order to quantify things... we need to be able to model the real world using mathematics."* The student also listed *"statistics or calculus or simple linear algebra."*\n**Reasoning:** The student understands that math is the tool used for **modeling** and **quantification**, rather than just calculation. Naming specific, relevant branches of mathematics demonstrates good context.\n\n### **5. "Engineering and Ethics"**\n**Score: 5/5**\n**Evidence:** *"It needs to as well as benefit the customer and the company... it also needs to benefit society. And ethics is a way we can guide our application... to the impacts on society."*\n**Reasoning:** This is an excellent introductory answer. The student identified engineering as a "profession" and correctly highlighted the paramount responsibility: prioritizing the benefit and safety of **society** alongside the needs of the employer.\n\n### **6. "How interesting their extras are"**\n**Score: 4/5**\n**Evidence:** *"Only that it\'s about generating products and services from requirements."*\n**Reasoning:** While not a "fun fact," this addition was intellectually interesting because it served to "professionalize" his earlier, more casual definition. It bridged the gap between his conceptual understanding and standard industry terminology.\n\n***\n\n**Overall Impression:**\nPeter demonstrated a high level of conceptual understanding for a first-year student. Despite the informal tone of his first answer, his grasp on constraints, modeling, and the societal obligation of ethics was precise and accurate.'

	{'model': 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5', 'response': '# Grade Report for Peter James Katsoukas (ID: 1234)\n\n## Dimensional Scores (0-5 scale)\n\n### 1. "What is engineering?" — **4/5**\n**Evidence:** "Engineering is the art of making what you want from stuff you can get" and later adds "it\'s about generating products and services from requirements."\n\n**Justification:** Peter provides a concise, practical definition that captures the transformative nature of engineering (converting available resources into desired outcomes). The addition about products/services from requirements shows understanding of the requirements-driven nature of the field. Not a 5 because it lacks explicit mention of problem-solving or systematic application, but it\'s a solid, memorable definition showing real understanding.\n\n### 2. "Engineering and Creativity" — **4/5**\n**Evidence:** "to do an engineering project you need to be creative to get around all of the constraints required for the project."\n\n**Justification:** Peter correctly identifies that creativity is essential in engineering, specifically linking it to working within constraints—a sophisticated understanding that creativity isn\'t "blue sky" thinking but constrained problem-solving. This shows mature comprehension of engineering creativity. Minor deduction for brevity, but the conceptual understanding is strong.\n\n### 3. "Engineering and Science" — **5/5**\n**Evidence:** "Engineering needs to interact with the real world and science is the way we inspect the real world and figure out the laws and physics and chemistry and biology of the real world."\n\n**Justification:** Excellent response. Peter articulates that science provides the foundational understanding of natural laws that engineering relies upon. He correctly positions science as investigative/descriptive and implies engineering applies this knowledge. Mentions multiple disciplines (physics, chemistry, biology) showing breadth of understanding.\n\n### 4. "Engineering and Mathematics" — **5/5**\n**Evidence:** "In order to quantify things in the real world we need to be able to model the real world using mathematics. So mathematics, whether it\'s statistics or calculus or simple linear algebra, we need to be able to use that in our engineering process."\n\n**Justification:** Outstanding answer. Peter explains the *why* (quantification and modeling of reality) and provides specific examples of mathematical tools (statistics, calculus, linear algebra). He connects mathematics to the engineering process explicitly. This demonstrates both conceptual understanding and awareness of specific applications.\n\n### 5. "Engineering and Ethics" — **5/5**\n**Evidence:** "engineering is a profession and it needs to as well as benefit the customer and the company that I\'m working for, it also needs to benefit society. And ethics is a way we can guide our application of engineering to the impacts on society."\n\n**Justification:** Exceptional response for an introductory course. Peter identifies multiple stakeholders (customer, company, society), recognizes engineering as a profession with broader responsibilities, and correctly positions ethics as a guiding framework for societal impact. This shows sophisticated understanding of professional responsibility.\n\n### 6. "How interesting their extras are" — **3/5**\n**Evidence:** "Only that it\'s about generating products and services from requirements."\n\n**Justification:** Peter adds a useful clarification that reinforces his understanding of engineering as requirements-driven and output-focused. It\'s relevant and accurate but relatively straightforward. A 3 reflects a solid, professional addition without exceptional creativity or personal insight.\n\n---\n\n## **Total Score: 26/30 (87%)**\n\n## Overall Assessment:\nPeter demonstrates strong conceptual understanding across all dimensions. His responses are concise yet substantive, showing he can articulate core concepts clearly. Particularly impressive are his responses on mathematics and ethics, which show sophisticated understanding of engineering as both a technical discipline and a profession with societal responsibilities. For a first engineering course, this is excellent performance.'

	{'model': 'openai/gpt-5.1', 'ranking': "Response A does several things well. It assigns scores on all six required dimensions and explicitly anchors each score to direct quotes from the transcript. The justifications are accurate and align closely with what the student actually said. It properly recognizes the strength of the student's understanding of constraints (creativity), modeling and quantification (math), and societal responsibility (ethics). Giving 5/5 on almost all dimensions is defensible here because, for an introductory course, the student’s answers are very strong conceptually. The slight deduction on the “extras” dimension to 4/5 is reasonable and is explained in a way that matches the content of the extra comment.\n\nWhat Response A does less well is mainly about nuance. It leans toward uncritical praise and doesn’t consider whether there’s any meaningful distinction between “excellent” and merely “very good” on some dimensions. For example, it could have briefly addressed why the initial informal definition of engineering is still worth full marks despite being more metaphorical than formal. But these are minor issues; it remains a solid, faithful grading.\n\n---\n\nResponse B is also strong and very similar in structure to Response A. It clearly labels each dimension, assigns a numeric score, and gives transcript-based evidence. It does a good job unpacking the conceptual distinctions the student is making, such as science as “inspection/discovery” versus engineering as “interaction/application,” and creativity as problem-solving under constraints rather than just aesthetics. This response does an especially nice job of explaining *why* each answer merits a 5/5, in terms that fit an Intro to Engineering context (e.g., pointing out the grasp of requirements and professional responsibility).\n\nIts weaknesses are again mostly about nuance rather than correctness. Like Response A, it awards straight 5s (except extras) and doesn’t consider any partial deductions, which is defensible but a little generous. It also occasionally layers on interpretation (“paramount responsibility”) that goes slightly beyond what the student literally said, though it stays within a reasonable reading of the answer. Overall, its reasoning is careful, grounded in the transcript, and pedagogically informative.\n\n---\n\nResponse C is accurate and detailed, and it also follows the rubric correctly, scoring all six dimensions and citing transcript evidence for each. It gives particularly clear, well-reasoned praise of the science, math, and ethics answers, and those 5/5 scores are very well justified. The overall summary at the end is helpful and consistent with the scores. It does not violate any of the exam rules (Pick One, Benefit of Doubt, etc.), and it correctly focuses on conceptual understanding rather than jargon.\n\nWhere Response C is weaker is in how it uses the scoring scale. It deducts points on “What is engineering?” largely because the student didn’t explicitly mention “problem-solving or systematic application,” even though the combination of “making what you want from stuff you can get” and “generating products and services from requirements” captures those ideas quite well for a first course. Similarly, it penalizes the creativity answer for being brief, despite that answer nailing a key idea—creativity to work around constraints—which is exactly the core concept the rubric is looking for. The “extras” score of 3/5 is defensible but a bit conservative given that the extra remark meaningfully sharpens the definition. So Response C is thoughtful and coherent but slightly too strict relative to the demonstrated understanding.\n\n---\n\nFINAL RANKING:\n1. Response B\n2. Response A\n3.

	{'model': 'google/gemini-3-pro-preview', 'ranking': 'Here is the evaluation of the three responses.\n\n### Response A Evaluation\nResponse A provides a clear, concise, and accurate assessment of the transcript. It follows the instructions well, particularly regarding "Jargon Leniency," by awarding full marks (5/5) for answers that were conceptually sound even if phrased simply (e.g., the "haiku"-style definition of engineering).\n**Pros:**\n- It correctly identifies that the student\'s simple definition covers the core concepts of resource transformation and requirements.\n- The formatting is clean and easy to read.\n- It appropriately weighs the "Extras" section, noting that the student used that opportunity to add a professional lens to their earlier definition.\n**Cons:**\n- The justification for the scores is a bit briefer than in Response B, though still sufficient.\n\n### Response B Evaluation\nResponse B is the strongest response. It separates specific "Evidence" from "Reasoning" for every dimension, which makes the grading logic transparent. Crucially, it explicitly addresses the grading philosophy in its reasoning. For instance, it notes that while the student\'s language was colloquial, the conceptual mastery was perfect, justifying the 5/5 scores under the rules provided.\n**Pros:**\n- Excellent structure separating evidence and reasoning.\n- Deepest insight into the qualitative aspect of the answers (e.g., noting how the "Extra" comment served to "professionalize" the earlier answer).\n- Perfectly adheres to the "Jargon Leniency" rule by focusing on the student\'s grasp of constraints, modeling, and societal benefit rather than their vocabulary.\n**Cons:**\n- None.\n\n### Response C Evaluation\nResponse C offers a comprehensive report with a total score calculation, but its grading logic is arguably too harsh given the context (Introductory course, Jargon Leniency).\n**Pros:**\n- Professional formatting with a calculated total score.\n- Detailed justifications for every grade.\n**Cons:**\n- It deducts points regarding the Definition (4/5) and Creativity (4/5) for reasons that contradict the "Jargon Leniency" rule. For example, it penalizes the student for "brevity" on the Creativity question, even though the student correctly identified the single most important concept (constraints).\n- It critiques the lack of specific words like "problem-solving," despite the student describing exactly that process conceptually. This feels closer to checking off keywords than evaluating understanding.\n\nFINAL RANKING:\n1. Response B\n2. Response A\n3. Response C', 'parsed_ranking': ['Response B', 'Response A', 'Response C'

	{'model': 'anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5', 'ranking': '## Evaluation of Individual Responses\n\n### Response A\n\n**Strengths:**\n- Provides clear, well-organized scores with bullet-pointed evidence for each dimension\n- Accurately captures key quotes from the transcript\n- Demonstrates good understanding of the grading criteria, particularly "jargon leniency" by accepting Peter\'s informal but conceptually accurate definitions\n- Strong justifications that focus on conceptual understanding rather than formal terminology\n- Recognizes the sophistication in Peter\'s constraint-based view of creativity\n- Appropriately contextualizes the "extras" score, noting it\'s brief but relevant\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Awards 5/5 on the first dimension ("What is engineering?") when Peter\'s definition, while creative and memorable, lacks some depth compared to more comprehensive definitions\n- The overall perfect scores (5/5 across five dimensions) may be slightly generous for an introductory course student, though not necessarily inaccurate\n- Brief overall summary at the end, though this isn\'t necessarily a flaw\n\n### Response B\n\n**Strengths:**\n- Excellent professional formatting with clear headers and student identification\n- Provides the most detailed reasoning sections that explain *why* each answer demonstrates understanding\n- Strong analytical commentary, particularly on creativity (distinguishing "artistic creativity" from "engineering creativity")\n- Excellent note on science vs. engineering: "discovery and understanding laws (inspection) vs. application and manipulation (interaction)"\n- Provides valuable overall impression that contextualizes performance for a first-year student\n- Shows sophisticated grading by recognizing how the final "extra" comment "professionalized" the earlier casual definition\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Like Response A, potentially slightly generous with perfect scores across the board\n- Could have been more critical on dimension 1, where the definition is somewhat informal\n\n### Response C\n\n**Strengths:**\n- Most balanced and nuanced grading approach with varied scores (4,
		4,
		5,
		5,
		5,
		3)\n- Provides explicit justifications for why certain answers aren\'t perfect 5s\n- The deduction on "What is engineering?" (4/5) is well-reasoned: notes lack of "explicit mention of problem-solving or systematic application"\n- The 3/5 on extras is appropriately calibrated - acknowledges the value while noting it\'s "relatively straightforward"\n- Includes a total score calculation (26/30,
		87%) which provides helpful context\n- Most comprehensive overall assessment that balances praise with constructive observation\n- Best demonstrates critical thinking in grading rather than defaulting to high scores\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- The deduction on creativity (4/5 for "brevity") seems somewhat arbitrary - Peter\'s answer was concise but complete\n- Slightly more formal/academic tone may be less accessible\n- The numerical total might not be required by the rubric\n\n## Analysis of Key Differences\n\nThe main differentiator is **grading rigor and discrimination**:\n- **Responses A & B**: Award 5/5 on five dimensions (only differing on extras with 4/5)\n- **Response C**: Awards 4,
		4,
		5,
		5,
		5,
		3 - showing more critical evaluation\n\nFor the critical first dimension ("What is engineering?"), Response C provides the most balanced assessment. Peter\'s "art of making what you want from stuff you can get" is indeed creative and shows understanding, but it\'s informal and lacks explicit mention of problem-solving, systematic methods, or other core engineering concepts. Response C appropriately gives this a 4/5, while A and B award perfect scores.\n\nOn the "extras" dimension, Response C\'s score of 3/5 seems most calibrated. Peter\'s addition was relevant but straightforward - not particularly "interesting" in the way the rubric dimension asks. Responses A and B award 4/5, which may be generous for such a brief, professional-but-not-fascinating addition.\n\nAll three responses demonstrate good understanding of the grading rules and show appropriate jargon leniency. However, Response C best demonstrates the evaluative discrimination expected in academic grading.\n\nFINAL RANKING:\n1. Response C\n2. Response B\n3.

"What is engineering?"**\n**Score: 5/5**\n**Evidence:** The student initially defined it as *"the art of making what you want from stuff you can get."* Later, they refined this to *"generating products and services from requirements."*\n**Reasoning:** While the initial definition was colloquial, it was conceptually flawless. It captured the core engineering principle of transforming available resources ("stuff you can get") into specific objectives ("what you want"). The addition of "requirements" at the end demonstrated a clear understanding of the formal design process without relying on buzzwords, adhering perfectly to the Jargon Leniency rule.\n\n### **2. "Engineering and Creativity"**\n**Score: 5/5**\n**Evidence:** *"You need to be creative to get around all of the constraints required for the project."*\n**Reasoning:** This is an excellent insight for an introductory student. He correctly identified that engineering creativity differs from artistic creativity because it is defined by **constraints**. He understands that creativity is the tool used to navigate limitations, arguably the most important concept in the course.\n\n### **3. "Engineering and Science"**\n**Score: 5/5**\n**Evidence:** *"Science is the way we inspect the real world and figure out the laws... Engineering needs to interact with the real world."*\n**Reasoning:** The student provided a sharp, accurate distinction: Science is about *discovery* ("inspection") and understanding laws, while Engineering is about *application* ("interaction").\n\n### **4. "Engineering and Mathematics"**\n**Score: 5/5**\n**Evidence:** *"In order to quantify things... we need to be able to model the real world using mathematics."* He specifically cited *"statistics or calculus or simple linear algebra."*\n**Reasoning:** The answer demonstrates that math is not just for calculation, but for **modeling** and **quantification**. Listing specific, relevant branches of mathematics (rather than just "arithmetic") showed valid contextual knowledge.\n\n### **5. "Engineering and Ethics"**\n**Score: 5/5**\n**Evidence:** *"It needs to as well as benefit the customer and the company... it also needs to benefit society. And ethics is a way we can guide our application... to the impacts on society."*\n**Reasoning:** A mature response establishing engineering as a "profession" with a tripartite responsibility: to the client, the employer, and most importantly, **society**. This clearly answers "what role does ethics play" by framing it as a guide for societal impact.\n\n### **6. "How interesting their extras are"**\n**Score: 4/5**\n**Evidence:** *"Only that it\'s about generating products and services from requirements."*\n**Reasoning:** While brief, this addition was highly functional. It bridged the gap between his earlier "haiku" definition and industry-standard terminology. It wasn\'t a "fun fact," but it showed he was thinking critically about his earlier answer and sought to professionalize it before the interview ended.\n\n***\n\n### **Overall Assessment**\n**Total Score: 29/30**\n\nPeter demonstrated exceptional conceptual understanding for a first-year student. While his language was occasionally informal ("stuff you can get"), his grasp of the underlying principles—specifically **constraints**, **modeling**, and **societal obligation**—was precise. He successfully communicated deep engineering concepts in plain English.'
